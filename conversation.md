**HUMAN:** What is a forward collision warning?

**AI:** A forward collision warning is a safety system that detects when your vehicle is approaching another vehicle ahead too quickly and provides critical alerts to help prevent rear-end collisions.

The system works by calculating speed, distance, and time to impact, then alerting drivers to brake in time - whether they're distracted or drowsy. It's designed to address common dangerous scenarios like:

• **Approaching stationary vehicles** - When closing in too quickly on stopped cars at intersections or in traffic
• **Unsafe tailgating** - Following too closely behind slower-moving or braking vehicles  
• **Sudden stops ahead** - When vehicles ahead suddenly stop or slow down to turn

Forward collision warning systems are proven effective, reducing crash rates by 27%. The alerts give drivers crucial reaction time to avoid accidents, and safety managers can also receive these notifications for coaching purposes.
